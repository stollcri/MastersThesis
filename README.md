# MastersThesis
This repository contains the code which I created as I worked toward my master's thesis. The code should not be considered production ready; it was used for experimentation and some parts are just hacked together, so it would not be wise to use it directly for anything critical. I am done with it now, so I am just making it available for reference.

My thesis can be found on [OhioLink's Electronic Thesis and Dissertation site](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=akron1428077337&disposition=inline), but the core concepts were boiled down in to [a short paper which I presented at IPCV'15](http://worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2015/IPC3194.pdf)
